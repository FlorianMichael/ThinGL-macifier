## Releases
### Gradle/Maven
To use ThinGL with Gradle/Maven you can get it from [Lenni0451's Maven](https://maven.lenni0451.net/#/snapshots/net/raphimc/thingl) or [Jitpack](https://jitpack.io/#RaphiMC/ThinGL).
You can also find instructions how to implement it into your build script there.

### Jar File
If you just want the latest jar file you can download it from [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/RaphiMC/ThinGL/actions/workflows/build.yml) or [Lenni0451's Jenkins](https://build.lenni0451.net/job/ThinGL/).

## Usage and Examples
Examples can be found in the [src/example](/src/example) directory.

### Logging
ThinGL by default logs to System.out and System.err.
You can however easily redirect the log messages to your own code by setting ``ThinGL.LOGGER`` to your own Logger.
